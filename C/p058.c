/* Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

 * It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
 * lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
 *
 * If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
 * what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?*/
