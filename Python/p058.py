# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
# lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
# what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

#   found, and divide by the number of elements of the diagonal, which are increase by 4 at 
#   every cycle. The next four number added to the diagonal are 13 (9+4), 17 (9+4+4), 21 and 25.
#   Then 25+6 etc., at every cycle the step is increased by 2. Continue until the ratio goes below 0.1.
