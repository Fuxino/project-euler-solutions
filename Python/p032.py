# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234,
# is 1 through 5 pandigital.
#
# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
#
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
#
# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

#   To get a 1 to 9 pandigital concatenation of the two factors and product,
#   we need to multiply a 1 digit number times a 4 digit numbers (the biggest
#   one digit number 9 times the biggest 3 digit number 999 multiplied give
#   8991 and the total digit count is 8, which is not enough), or a 2 digit 
#   number times a 3 digit number (the smallest two different 3 digits number,
#   100 and 101, multiplied give 10100, and the total digit count is 11, which
#   is too many). The outer loop starts at 2 because 1 times any number gives
#   the same number, so its digit will be repeated and the result can't be 
#   pandigital. The nested loop starts from 1234 because it's the smallest 
#   4-digit number with no repeated digits, and it ends at 4987 because it's
#   the biggest number without repeated digits that multiplied by 2 gives a 
#   4 digit number.
